Prompt: Write a PHP method for a paycheck tracker that increases bonuses by a percentage.

The method did what I asked — it added the bonus increase using math that makes sense.  
But it didn’t have any input checks, so I added a condition that only runs if the percent is above zero.  
Without that, it could mess things up with negative values.

It was useful and quick to plug in, but I’d want better validation if I used it in something bigger.
